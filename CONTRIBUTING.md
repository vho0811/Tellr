- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding or fixing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `feat: add story browser component`

## Code Style

We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain code quality. Please make sure your code passes all linting checks before submitting a PR.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if appropriate
2. The PR should work on the latest development branch
3. The PR needs approval from at least one maintainer
